## LIB: Library of reusable verification components

Verification Components for the CORE-V verification environments.  Examples
include UVM Agents for various physical interfaces, memory models, virtual peripherals, etc.

There is a great debate between mike@openhwgroup.org and aimeepsutton@metrics.ca about where the
riscv-gnu-toolchain should go here.  If you have an opinion, send a comment/question to both of us.
